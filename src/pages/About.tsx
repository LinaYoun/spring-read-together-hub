            <p className="mb-4">
              Spring Book Club was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate readers who wanted to create a community centered around English literature. What started as informal gatherings in a small caf√© has grown into a vibrant community of book lovers from diverse backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to foster a love for reading, provide a platform for meaningful discussions, and create connections through shared literary experiences. We believe that books have the power to transform, inspire, and unite people.
